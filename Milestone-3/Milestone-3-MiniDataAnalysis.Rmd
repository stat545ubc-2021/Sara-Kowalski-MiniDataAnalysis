## 1  Introduction
Hello! The following document contains the work required to complete Milestone 3 of the Mini Data Analysis Project in STAT545A.  

Much of the inspiration for this script comes from [Heads or Tails](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/tidy-titarnic) and from the [instructions](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-3/) provided for the project.

## 2  Load Packages 
### 2.1 Load **datateachr** and **tidyverse**

```{r}
## Load dataset package - datateachr
library(datateachr)

## Load tidyverse - a collection of R packages used for data analysis
library(tidyverse) 
```

### 2.2 My Research Questions

1. Question 1:
What is the distribution for tree species (from a specified genus (e.g. Ulmus)) within Vancouver neighbourhoods? Are certain tree species favored over others in specific neighbourhoods? 

2. Question 2:
Within each genus, what is the distribution of the diameter of the trees for each species? Which species have a wider diameter distribution and which ones have a more narrow distribution?
