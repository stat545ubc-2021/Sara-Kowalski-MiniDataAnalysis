### Project Goals 
The overarching goal of this project is to conduct a mini data analysis on the dataset of our choosing using the tools we have learned in class. Specifically we will be exploring a dataset within R studio and using the tidyverse package to manipulate and visualize our data and then prepare it for presentation. For my project, I have chosen to explore the *vancouver_trees* dataset which contains an abundance of data on the types of trees planted within the different neighbourhoods of the City of Vancouver. There are 3 milestones that must be completed for this project, each with their own distinct goals which are outlined in the specific README found in each milestone folder.
